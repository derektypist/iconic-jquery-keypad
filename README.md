# Iconic jQuery Keypad

The purpose of the project is to provide an Iconic Keypad, using the Font Awesome Icons and the Technology of jQuery.

## UX

The aim is to provide a keypad with the Font Awesome Icons for various activities, such as Computing, Music and News.

As a user, when I hover over the buttons, I expect a screentip to be displayed.

As a user, when I hover over the display, I get a different color.

As a user, when I click on a button with the `Redo Icon`, I expect the message `Select Activity` to be displayed.  The background color stays the same.

As a user, when I click on the button with an icon, I expect the name of the activity (e.g. `Python`) to be displayed.  Except on the button with the `Redo Icon`.

As a user, when I click on a button with the `Adjust Icon`, I get a different background color.  The background colors run from seagreen, blue, purple,orangered, olive, brown, deeppink and cornflowerblue.  When the button with the `Adjust Icon` is clicked and the background color is `cornflowerblue`, the background color goes back to `seagreen`.  However, the message or activity on the display is the same.

As a user, when I hover over the buttons, I get a different background color.
