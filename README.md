# Iconic jQuery Keypad

The purpose of the project is to provide an Iconic Keypad, using the Font Awesome Icons and the Technology of jQuery.

## UX

As a user, when I hover over the buttons, I expect a tooltip to be displayed.

As a user, when I click on a button with the `Redo Icon`, I expect the message `Select Activity` to be displayed.

As a user, when I click on the button with an icon, I expect the name of the activity (e.g. `Python`) to be displayed.  Except on buttons with the `Redo` and `Adjust` icons.

As a user, when I click on a button with the `Adjust Icon`, I get a different background color.  However, the message or activity on the display is the same.

As a user, when I hover over the buttons, I get a different background color.
